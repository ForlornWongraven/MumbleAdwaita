## MumbleAdwaita

This is a mumble skin with matching colours for the GNOME default theme Adwaita and a touch of my favourite internet spaceship pixel game guild "Pandemic Legion".


Based on Mumble Lite Theme https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-theme
and MetroMumble Theme by xPoke https://github.com/xPoke/MetroMumble .

##### Modification
