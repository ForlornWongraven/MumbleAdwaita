## MumblePL

This is a mumble skin for any linux desktop with a touch of my favourite internet spaceship pixel game guild "Pandemic Legion".


Based on [Mumble Lite Theme](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-theme)
and [MetroMumble Theme by xPoke](https://github.com/xPoke/MetroMumble).

##### Installation

Download the repository and unzip the file in a new folder. In Mumble go to Configure > Settings > User Interface > Look and Feel. Choose Skin: YourFolder/PandemicLegion.qss . Hit Apply and restart Mumble.


##### Modification

If you need to change the look of the theme please change /source/PandemicLegion.scss and rebuild the theme with ```sass /source/PandemicLegion.scss PandemicLegion.qss```.
